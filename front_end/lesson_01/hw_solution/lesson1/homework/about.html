    <h1>NISSAN SKYLINE R34 GT-R</h1>
    <h2>Fifth generation (1999 - 2002)</h2>

    <p>The GF-BNR34 (R34) Skyline GT-R, GT-R V·Spec and GT-R V·Spec N1 models were introduced in January 1999. 
        The R34 GT-R was shorter (from front to rear), and the front overhang was reduced as compared to its predecessor. 
        The valve covers were painted glossy red (colour code Cherry Red Effect Z24 or X1020), 
        as opposed to black in previous models.</p>

    <p>A new feature on the R34 GT-R is a 5.8" LCD multifunction display on the centre of the dashboard, 
        which shows seven different live readings of engine and vehicle statistics such as turbocharger pressure (1.2 bar max), 
        oil and water temperature, among others. 
        The GT-R V·Spec model added two extra features to the display: intake and exhaust gas temperatures. 
        Nismo Multi-function Displays (MFD) could be bought at an extra cost, they included a lap timer, 
        G-Force meter and an increase in boost pressure measurement to 2 bar. 
        The R34 GT-R was made shorter in response to customer concerns who thought the R33 was too bulky.</p>

    <p>Like the R33, the new R34 GT-R V·Spec (Victory Specification) models come equipped with the ATTESA E-TS Pro system and an Active LSD at the rear, 
        while standard GT-R models come with the non-Pro system and a conventional mechanical differential. 
        The V·Spec model also had firmer suspension and lower ground clearance, thanks to front and side splitters, 
        as well as a rear carbon fibre air diffuser, designed to keep air flowing smoothly under the car.</p>
