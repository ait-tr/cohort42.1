    <h1>Gorilas</h1>
    <h2>Gorilas habitat</h2>
    <p>Over one third of the global population of mountain gorillas live on the 
        lush slopes of the Parkâ€™s dormant volcanoes.
         Compared to their eastern lowland cousins, mountain gorillas have thicker hair, 
         an adaptation which protects them against the sub-zero temperatures often encountered
         at altitudes of 7,000 to 14,000 ft (2,000 to 4,000 m).</p>

    <h2>Behavior</h2>   
    <p>Like most primates, mountain gorillas are social animals. 
        They live in groups of fascinating complexity called troops or bands, 
        led by a dominant alpha male known as a silverback. 
        The silverback protects its members and directs troop activities such as nesting, 
        feeding and migration between seasonal feeding areas.</p>
